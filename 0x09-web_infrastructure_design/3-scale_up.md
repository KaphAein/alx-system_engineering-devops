Certainly! Let's break down the additions to the infrastructure and why they are added:

Additional Server:

Each component (web server, application server, database) is placed on its own dedicated server to isolate resources and enhance scalability, fault tolerance, and security.
Adding separate servers for each component allows for better resource management and isolation of functionalities, reducing the risk of interference between services and providing scalability options.
Load-Balancer (HAProxy) Cluster:

A load balancer is added to distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers hosting the same application.
Configuring HAProxy as a cluster ensures high availability and fault tolerance. If one load balancer fails, the other can seamlessly take over, ensuring uninterrupted service.
Load balancing improves performance by distributing traffic evenly across multiple servers, preventing any single server from being overwhelmed and improving response times for users.
Split Components:

Web Server: The web server (e.g., Nginx or Apache) handles HTTP requests, serves static content, and manages SSL termination. Separating it from the application server allows for specialized configuration and optimization.
Application Server: The application server (e.g., Gunicorn, uWSGI) runs the application code, executes business logic, and interacts with the database. Isolating it from the web server enhances security and scalability.
Database Server: The database server (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) stores and manages application data. Running it on a separate server improves performance, scalability, and security.
