What is a server?

A server is a computer or a software system that provides functionality or services to other computers or clients, often over a network. Servers can serve various purposes, such as hosting websites, storing files, processing data, or running applications.
What is the role of the domain name?

The domain name serves as a human-readable label that represents a unique address on the internet. It helps users locate and access resources such as websites, emails, or other services. Domain names are translated into IP addresses by the Domain Name System (DNS) to route traffic to the appropriate servers.
What type of DNS record is www in www.foobar.com?

The DNS record type for "www" in www.foobar.com is typically a CNAME (Canonical Name) record. This record type allows the domain www.foobar.com to alias another domain name, often pointing to the same server or IP address as foobar.com.
What is the role of the web server?

The web server's role is to handle HTTP requests from clients (such as web browsers) and serve web content in response. It delivers static content like HTML files, images, CSS, and JavaScript to users' browsers. Additionally, it can also handle tasks like URL routing, SSL/TLS encryption, and managing server-side technologies like CGI, PHP, or ASP.NET.
What is the role of the application server?

The application server is responsible for executing application logic and processing dynamic content. It interacts with databases, processes user input, generates dynamic web pages, and manages application-specific tasks such as authentication, session management, and business logic. Application servers often run middleware or frameworks like Django, Ruby on Rails, or Node.js.
What is the role of the database?

The database stores, manages, and organizes structured data for retrieval and manipulation. It serves as a persistent data storage solution for web applications, storing user information, content, configuration settings, and other application data. The database management system (DBMS), such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB, facilitates data management, query processing, and data integrity enforcement.
What is the server using to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website?

The server communicates with the user's computer over the internet using the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) or its secure variant, HTTPS (HTTP Secure). These protocols define the rules for formatting and transmitting requests and responses between web servers and clients, enabling the exchange of web content and data.
SPOF (Single Point of Failure):

SPOF refers to a component within a system that, if it fails, would cause the entire system to fail. It represents a vulnerability in the system's architecture where the failure of a single component can disrupt the entire operation. Redundancy, fault tolerance, and failover mechanisms are implemented to mitigate the risks associated with SPOFs.
Downtime when maintenance needed (like deploying new code web server needs to be restarted):

During maintenance activities such as deploying new code or restarting servers, downtime may occur, resulting in temporary unavailability of services. Strategies such as rolling updates, blue-green deployments, and utilizing redundant systems can help minimize downtime and maintain service continuity during maintenance windows.
Cannot scale if too much incoming traffic:

If a system cannot scale to handle increasing levels of incoming traffic, it may become overwhelmed, leading to degraded performance or downtime. Scalability measures such as load balancing, horizontal scaling (adding more servers), caching, and content delivery networks (CDNs) can help distribute and manage traffic efficiently to ensure the system can handle varying loads without experiencing bottlenecks.
