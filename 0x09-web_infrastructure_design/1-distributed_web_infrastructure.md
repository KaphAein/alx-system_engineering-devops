Addition of Elements:

Each additional element in the infrastructure serves a specific purpose and is added to enhance functionality, performance, reliability, or security.
For example, the addition of a load balancer helps distribute incoming traffic among multiple servers to improve scalability and availability.
Load Balancer Distribution Algorithm:

The load balancer is configured with a round-robin distribution algorithm. This algorithm evenly distributes incoming requests among the available backend servers in a sequential manner.
Round-robin ensures that each server receives an equal share of the incoming traffic, promoting load balancing and preventing any single server from being overwhelmed.
Active-Active vs. Active-Passive Setup:

The load balancer is configured for an Active-Active setup.
In an Active-Active setup, all servers actively handle incoming requests simultaneously, distributing the load evenly among them. This setup offers increased scalability, performance, and fault tolerance.
In contrast, an Active-Passive setup involves one server actively serving requests while the others remain on standby. If the active server fails, one of the passive servers takes over. This setup provides redundancy but may underutilize resources during normal operation.
Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) Database Cluster:

In a Primary-Replica database cluster, the primary node (master) serves as the primary read-write node, handling write operations and serving read requests.
The replica nodes (slaves) replicate data from the primary node asynchronously or synchronously, depending on the configuration. They serve as backups and can handle read requests, providing scalability and fault tolerance.
The replication ensures that data remains consistent across all nodes in the cluster, enhancing data availability and reliability.
Difference Between Primary and Replica Nodes:

The primary node handles write operations and serves as the authoritative source for data modifications.
Replica nodes replicate data from the primary node and serve read requests. They provide redundancy and scalability but do not accept write operations directly.
In terms of the application, the primary node is responsible for handling write operations and ensuring data consistency, while replica nodes help distribute read requests and provide fault tolerance.
Issues with the Infrastructure:

Single Points of Failure (SPOFs): The infrastructure lacks redundancy in critical components such as the database, application server, and load balancer, potentially leading to downtime if any of these components fail.
Security Issues: The absence of a firewall and HTTPS encryption exposes the infrastructure to security risks, including unauthorized access, data breaches, and interception of sensitive information.
Lack of Monitoring: Without proper monitoring tools and processes in place, it's challenging to identify and address performance issues, security threats, and system failures in a timely manner, increasing the risk of prolonged downtime and compromised system integrity.
